          <h3>Rungtip Wonglersak (2016)</h3>
          <p>Rungtip did a masters research project investigating the effects of climate change on ecosystems using the <a href="./projects.html#madingleymodel">Madingley Model</a>. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rungtip_Wonglersak2" target="_blank">Rungtip is currently finishing her masters course</a> in Biodiversity, Evolution and Conservation at University College London.</p>

          <h3>Laura Bentley (2015)</h3>
          <p>Laura did an internship at WCMC, using the <a href="./projects.html#predicts">PREDICTS Project</a> data to investigate whether responses of species to land use vary dependding upon trophic level. Laura has just finished a masters course at Imperial College London, and is about to start <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/laura-bentley-3574ab103" target="_blank">a PhD at the University of Cambridge</a>.</p>

          <h3>Martin Jung (2014)</h3>
          <p>While at UNEP-WCMC, I co-supervised Martin's masters project at the Centre for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate at Copenhagen University. He compared the estimates of the effects of land use made by the models of the <a href="./projects.html#predicts">PREDICTS Project</a> with new data he collected in Kenya and Tanzania. A manuscript from his project is currently under review. <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/357982" target="_blank">Martin is currently studying for a PhD at the University of Sussex</a>, investigating the effects of different land systems on biodiversity.</p>

          <h3>Rebecca Senior (2013)</h3>
          <p>Rebecca did an extended internship at UNEP-WCMC, working on various sub-projects within the <a href="./projects.html#predicts">PREDICTS Project</a>, notably an analysis of changes in the functional structure of plant communities in response to land use, from which a manuscript is in preparation. <a href="http://www.edwardslab.group.shef.ac.uk/rebecca_senior" target="_blank">Rebecca is currently working toward a PhD at Sheffield University</a>, studying the effects of logging on local climatic conditions and amphibian biodiversity.</p>

          <h3>Edwin Pynegar (2012)</h3>
          <p>Edwin did an internship at UNEP-WCMC, in which he collected data with which to evaluate the predictions about organism allometries made by the <a href="./projects.html#madingleymodel">The Madingley Model</a> and contributed to the early data collection for the <a href="./projects.html#predicts">PREDICTS Project</a>. <a href="http://afp236.wixsite.com/edwinpynegar" target="_blank">Edwin is now studying for a PhD at Bangor University</a>, assessing the effectiveness of Payments for Ecosystem Services schemes in Bolivia.</p>

          <h3>Abigayil Blandon (2012)</h3>
          <p>Abigayil did an internship at UNEP-WCMC, contributing to the early data collection of the <a href="./projects.html#predicts">PREDICTS Project</a>. Abigayil currently works for the UK's Joint Nature Conservation Committee.</p>

          <h3>Robert Wilson (2011)</h3>
          <p>While at UNEP-WCMC, I co-supervised Robert's masters project with the now-discontinued Mathematics in the Living Environment (MILE) Programme at the University of York. Robert's project investigated spatial patterns in the average body mass of amphibian communities in Europe. Robert did a PhD and is <a href="http://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/robert-j-wilson(00d4be81-1aba-43f1-bbe7-75466983be58).html" target="_blank">now a post-doc at the University of Strathclyde</a>.</p>
